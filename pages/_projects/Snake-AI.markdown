        <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> that <strong>plays snake</strong>.<br>
        This is <u>not an artifical intelligence that learns how to play</u> it but, given certain data, it <strong>finds the best way to achieve the objectives</strong> which are only 3 for this game: Eat the apples and avoid hitting the wall or himself.<br>
        To implementi it, I used <strong>python</strong>, more precisely <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news" target="_blank"><strong>pygame</strong></a> for the game and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank"><strong>tensorflow</strong></a> for the AI. <br>
        This AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a <strong>preadded model</strong>. Is commonly called <em>"model-based artificial intelligence"</em> or <em>"neural network-based artificial intelligence"</em>. This approach is part of <strong>supervised learning</strong>, where a model is trained on a <strong>dataset labeled</strong> and then used to <strong>make predictions</strong> about new data without further adaptation during use. <br>
        For "training" the AI use both fruit and snake position and their distance so the AI can <strong>calculate the best path to achieve the apple without hit something</strong> (By now the record of apple eaten is of 53 apples :) ). <br>
