    <p>Remake of the original "Tomb Of the Mask" mobile game.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p class="description">
        The game consists of taking all the <strong>stars</strong> on the map. To move you will use the arrows if you are on PC and the swipe if you are on mobile.
        The levels also feature two traps. The first <strong>"static spikes"</strong> will only kill you if you physically walk over them, while the other <strong>"dynamic spikes"</strong> will activate when they pass and, if you don't clear the area immediately, you will be killed.
        To finish the level you will have to get to where the <strong>glowing</strong> square is. Once you reach the "finish line", a screen will appear that allows you to return to the home page.<br>
