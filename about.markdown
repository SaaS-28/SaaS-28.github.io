    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I’m Samuel Onidi, I’m 18 years old and I like to write code. From an early age I became interested in computer science until I became interested in coding. I started developing small school projects until I came up with more personal projects that allowed me to learn something new (even the site I’m doing now is allowing me to increase my skills). For some years I have been interested in the development of video games and then lately I started to study the basics to start writing code on game engines like Godot.
